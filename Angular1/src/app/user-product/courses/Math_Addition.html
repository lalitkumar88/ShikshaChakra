<p>Math addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation that combines two or more numbers to calculate their sum. The process involves taking numerical values, called addends, and combining them to produce a total, known as the sum. The symbol "+" represents addition in mathematical notation.

Here is a basic example of addition with two numbers, 

a and b

a+b=c

In this equation:

a and 

b are the addends.
"+" is the addition operator.

c is the sum.
For instance, if a=5 and b=3, then the addition operation would be:

5+3=8

In this case, 

c (the sum) is equal to 8. Addition is commutative, meaning that changing the order of the addends does not affect the result. In other words, 

a+b=b+a.

The concept of addition is foundational in mathematics and has applications in various fields, ranging from basic calculations in everyday life to more complex mathematical and scientific computations.
